# Instagram Story Viewer Web App üì∏‚ú®

Welcome to the **Instagram Story Viewer** Web App! This is a simple interactive web app that mimics the Instagram story feature. You can scroll through different user profiles and when you click on a profile picture, it displays the user's story in the background for a few seconds. 

The app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features a horizontally scrollable list of users, styled in a card format, and a smooth interaction that reveals a full-screen image when a profile is clicked.

## Features üåü

- Scroll through different user profiles like on Instagram stories.
- Click on a profile to reveal the user's story as a background image.
- The full-screen story automatically disappears after a few seconds.
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes.

## Project Structure üìÇ

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the Instagram Story Viewer.
- `index.css`: The CSS file for styling the profile cards and full-screen story.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file handling the interactions for displaying user profiles and their stories.
  
## How It Works ‚ö°

- **Profile Card Display**: A horizontal scroll displays user profile pictures and names, similar to the Instagram story interface. The layout is designed using **flexbox**.
